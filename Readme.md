# 2ndBrain 🧠

Welcome to my 2nd Brain, an attempt to organize my messy ass brain. Formerly known as ObsiVault (shit name i know).

## What's Inside?

- **☁️ Ideas**
  Any interesting or uninteresting idea for a project that pops up in my brain.

- **✅ Actions**
  Any thing that i need to do but have so little braincells to remember.

- **✒️ Projects**
  Outlines and drafts for projects, big or small, that I’m working on (or dreaming about).

- **🌍 Atlas**
  A basic guide through my interconnected notes and topics—helping me (and maybe you) navigate my thought maze.

- **💗 Life**
  Personal notes, stories, and reflections on the ups and downs of everyday life.

- **💭 Thoughts**
  A catch-all for musings that don’t really fit anywhere else.

- **💵 Finances**
  Managing my broke ass here.

- **🖼️ Attachments**
  Miscellaneous clippings and files that I find useful, even if they’re a bit random.

- **🗿 Stoned**
  Final versions of work that have been polished and are ready to be considered complete.

- **🧠 Learn**
  Bits of knowledge and notes from the things I pick up along the way.
## How I Use It

I run this setup using Obsidian, which makes linking and organizing my notes a breeze. It might not be perfect, but it does the trick in keeping my thoughts from getting lost in the daily shuffle.
